## What Was Built

A 4-page static website for a fictional pain management clinic, deployed via GitHub Pages. Built incrementally using the Generic GitHub Website Playbook to avoid the timeout and hallucination issues encountered in the previous `apex-pain-clinic-demo` build.

### Pages
| Page | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `index.html` | Hero, trust bar ticker, services preview, about teaser, team teaser, contact form |
| Services | `services.html` | Full 6-service grid with page banner |
| About | `about.html` | Mission, core values list, stats band |
| Team | `team.html` | 3 doctor cards with specialties |

## Design System (tokens.css)

- **Color palette:** Muted blue-steel primary (`#2c5f7a`), warm white surface, soft grays for text hierarchy
- **Typography:** System font stack; fluid scale using `clamp()` for headings
- **Spacing:** Token-based scale (`--space-1` through `--space-20`) applied consistently across all sections
- **Shadows:** 3-level system (`--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md`, `--shadow-lg`)
- **Border radius:** `--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, `--radius-lg`, `--radius-full`

---

## Key Component Decisions

### Navigation
- Sticky header with scroll-triggered shadow via JS
- Mobile hamburger toggle with `aria-expanded` state managed in `main.js`
- `aria-current="page"` set on active nav link per page
- All nav links close the mobile menu on click

### Trust Bar
- CSS keyframe marquee ticker (`aria-hidden="true"` on the track — purely decorative)
- Items duplicated in HTML for seamless loop without JS

### Hero
- Full-viewport with overlay and `aria-labelledby` pointing to `h1`
- Scroll arrow links to `#services` section with `aria-label`
- Reduced-motion: animation disabled via `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`

### Contact Form
- `novalidate` + native `checkValidity()` / `reportValidity()` for validation
- Success message uses `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` + `aria-atomic="true"`
- All required fields have both `required` and `aria-required="true"`
- All inputs have `autocomplete` attributes (`name`, `email`, `tel`, `off`)
- Date field has `aria-describedby` pointing to a visible hint span

## Accessibility Checklist ✅

- [x] `lang="en"` on `<html>`
- [x] Skip link to `#main` on every page
- [x] All landmark roles (`banner`, `main`, `contentinfo`, `navigation`)
- [x] `aria-current="page"` on active nav link
- [x] `aria-expanded` toggled in JS on mobile nav
- [x] `aria-label` on all icon-only buttons and links
- [x] `aria-hidden="true"` on all decorative SVGs and elements
- [x] Form `autocomplete`, `aria-required`, `aria-describedby`
- [x] Form success `role="status"` + `aria-live` + `aria-atomic`
- [x] Doctor tag lists labelled with `aria-label="Specialties"`
- [x] Decorative dot spans in values list hidden from AT
- [x] Reduced motion support via CSS

---

## Mobile QA ✅

- Verified at 375px (iPhone SE) across all 4 pages
- Two breakpoints: `≤768px` and `≤480px`
- Hero, sections, cards, buttons, stats, footer all verified
- `btn--nav` excluded from full-width rule at 480px
- Stats numbers use `clamp()` to prevent overflow on small screens

---

## What Worked Well

- **Incremental build strategy** — building one section/page at a time eliminated timeouts and kept each commit focused
- **tokens.css first** — design coherence across all 4 pages required zero style backtracking
- **Semantic HTML from day one** — the a11y audit required only minor additions, not structural rewrites
- **CSS-only trust bar ticker** — no JS dependency for the marquee animation
- **`aria-hidden` on decorative SVGs** — established early as a default pattern, saved audit time

## Post-Build Fixes (July 5, 2026)

### Logo & Favicon Consistency Fix
- **Problem:** `services.html`, `about.html`, and `team.html` had the old vertical spine SVG logo and incorrect favicon from an earlier design iteration. Only `index.html` had the correct gradient tile logo.
- **Fix:** All three inner pages updated with the correct square `36×36` gradient tile nav logo (`#1e7a8c → #0e4a6e`) and matching `32×32` favicon. Each page uses a unique gradient ID (`tileGrad-sv`, `tileGrad-ab`, `tileGrad-tm`) to avoid SVG gradient conflicts.
- **CSS cache-busting:** All inner pages updated to `tokens.css?v=2` and `style.css?v=2`.
- **Commit:** `0154fa3` — all 4 pages now visually consistent.

## Open Items / Future Enhancements

- [ ] Replace placeholder doctor avatar initials with real/AI-generated headshot photos
- [ ] Connect contact form to a backend (e.g. Formspree, Netlify Forms)
- [ ] Add a Testimonials / Reviews section to index.html
- [ ] Add a Locations page or map embed
- [ ] Add Open Graph meta tags for social sharing previews
- [ ] Consider adding a blog/articles section for SEO
- [ ] Privacy Policy and Terms of Use pages (currently placeholder `#` links)

## Next Project: Client CMS

This site is earmarked as the **first test case** for a custom-built CMS system. The plan:

- Build a web app CMS (separate repo) where clients can log in and edit their site's live content (text, headings, paragraphs) and publish instantly
- Admin dashboard (owner view) shows all clients and all sites in one place, fully siloed
- Stack: **GitHub + Vercel + MongoDB**
- Apex Pain Clinic will be migrated from GitHub Pages → Vercel and its content wired to MongoDB as the first proof of concept

## Lessons for Future Builds

1. Always establish `tokens.css` before writing any component styles
2. Set `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative SVGs as the default at write time, not during audit
3. Add `autocomplete` attributes to form inputs at build time — not as an afterthought
4. Duplicate trust bar items in HTML (not JS) for CSS-only animation loops
5. Apply `aria-required` alongside HTML `required` from the start
6. Two-breakpoint mobile strategy (`≤768px` + `≤480px`) is sufficient for this site type
7. Use unique SVG gradient IDs per page (`tileGrad-sv`, `tileGrad-ab`, `tileGrad-tm`) to prevent gradient conflicts when the same inline SVG logo appears across multiple pages
